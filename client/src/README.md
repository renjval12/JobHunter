# Job Hunter 🪝
*Job hunting is a full-time job, so, why not get some help from a manager?*
## Overview

**Job Hunter** is a fullstack application, that utilizes **React**, **Java**, **Springboot**, and **MySQL** database. Job Hunter helps users keep track of all of their job search efforts. All the user has to do it is add a search, and they'll be able to edit it. 
## Usage

### Add Job Search 

The user goes to the "**Add Search**" tab of the webpage, enter the date they applied, the job title they applied for, the company name they applied to, the job posting URL they used, the company contact number, and any comments about the job search effort.  

### Update and Delete Searches

With the use of MySQL database, users are able to not only add their job searches, but also, with the use of **PUT** mapping in Springboot (with Hibernate as the ORM), the user is also able to update and delete individual job searches. 

## Technologies Used
The following with an exhaustive list of project management tools, technologies, frameworks, and libraries used for this project:

 -   [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
-   [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
-   [Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse](https://spring.io/tools)
-   [Java SE (v17)](https://www.oracle.com/java/)
- [Jira Software](https://renee-valentine.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/OHMT/boards/2?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNDIzYzA4YTlmZDg2NDhhNTliY2VmOGEzOWQ5MzEyM2QiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)

## Stretch Goals
This project is still a work in progress, and I intend on making in the future:

-   Create authentication functionality for login (if user is authenticated, then user gains access to the management tool. Otherwise, they receive a message: "Access Denied: Invalid User")
-   May use a third 3rd party api that relates to your REST API
